            <h3>Rat History</h3>

            <p>The domesticated rat has uncertain origins. The first evicendce of rats being kept as pets is as
                early
                as the Edo period (1603-1868) in Japan. The earliest recorded breeding of rats dates back to 1654.
            </p>
            <p>Rats being bred for food and sport began in the early 1800's in England, France, and North America.
                Rats were used in baiting events where men would bet on how many rats a dog could kill per round.
            </p>
            <p class="extra"> Brown rats were some of the earliest to be used in laboratory experiments. By the early
                1900's rat
                strains bred specifically for lab experiments began. It is believed that pet rats were dereived from
                these lab rats.</p>

        <h3>Rat Species</h3>
        <dl class="columns">
            <dt>Standard</dt>
            <dd class="pos">Noun</dd> <!--row??-->

            <dd>The standard rat has short glossy hair. This variety is closest to brown wild rats. They are omnivores
                and do not need to be given a special diet.</dd>
            <dt>Rex</dt>
            <dd class="pos">Noun</dd>
            <dd>Rex rats have curly, wooly seeming coats with curly whiskers. Their coats are closer in relation to
                guiea pigs and cats beacuse they do not have many guard hairs.</dd>
            <dt>Tailess</dt>
            <dd class="pos">Noun</dd>
            <dd>Tailess rats do not have tails as the name suggest, in place they have a stub of sorts. They need
                additional care
                becasue a rats tail is incredibly improtant to their movement and hygiene. This breed is especially
                susceptible to health issues.</dd>
            <dt>Hairless</dt>
            <dd class="pos">Noun</dd>
            <dd>These rats have no hair, not even whiskers. They need additional care and warmth because of their lack
                of hair. They are also more susceptible to illness because of their breeding. A way to combat the cold
                is to put them in a tiny sweater.</dd>
            <dt>Satin</dt>
            <dd class="pos">Noun</dd>
            <dd>Satin rats have long flowing coats with very smooth fur. They do not require any additional care.</dd>
            <dt>Dumbo</dt>
            <dd class="pos">Noun</dd>
            <dd>Dumbo rats are also a very common breed looking quite similar to the standard rat. The only difference
                is their ears, which are set lower on the head similar to Disney's Dumbo the elephant.</dd>
            <dt>Bristle Coat</dt>
            <dd class="pos">Noun</dd>
            <dd class="extra">Bristle coat rats have a coarse wirey fur similar to a terrier. They also have curly

        <h3>Rat Behaviors</h3>
        <dl class="columns">
            <dt>Group </dt>
            <dd class="pos">Noun</dd>
            <dd>Domesticated rats prefer to be in groups of at least two if not more. They are very social animals that
                need the stimulation of other rats.</dd>
            <dt>Solo</dt>
            <dd class="pos">Noun</dd>
            <dd>Rats kept as solo pets tend to live shorter lives, and get sick more often than rats raised in a group.
                A single rat is not a happy rat.</dd>
            <dt>Play Fighting</dt>
            <dd class="pos">Verb</dd>
            <dd>Rats love to play, they play with each other, themselves, and their owners. This is how they bond,
                especially domesticated rats. </dd>
            <dt>Boggling</dt>
            <dd class="pos">Verb</dd>
            <dd>This is a very strange behavior to witness as a rat owner. Boggling or bruxism occurs when the rat is
                happy, similar to the purring of a cat. The behavior occurs by the rat grinding it's teeth together
                rapidly causing their eyes to seemingly pop out of their head. Boggling can occur when the rat is in
                distress, but taking in all the enviornmental factors of the rat will quickly tell you whether the rat
                is happy or in distress.</dd>
            <dt>Zoomies</dt>
            <dd class="pos">Adjective</dd>
            <dd class="extra">This behavior is affectionately named after the happy running rats will do when they
                experience joy.
                They often display this behavior infront of their owners and each other while playing.</dd>
